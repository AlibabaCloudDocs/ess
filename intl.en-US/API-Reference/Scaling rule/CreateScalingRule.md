# CreateScalingRule {#doc_api_Ess_CreateScalingRule .reference}

You can call this operation to create a scaling rule to define specific scaling actions.

## Description {#description .section}

A scaling rule defines the scaling action to be executed, such as adding or removing ECS instances and the number of instances to be scaled. If the number of ECS instances after a scaling rule is executed is smaller than MinSize or greater than MaxSize of a scaling group, Auto Scaling automatically adds or removes ECS instances. In this case, Auto Scaling keeps the number of ECS instances in the scaling group to MinSize or MaxSize while the specified number of instances to be scaled in the scaling rule is ignored and remains unchanged. You can create scaling rules based on input parameters.

-   Example 1: A scaling group has a MaxSize of 3, a TotalCapacity of 2, and a scaling rule of adding three ECS instances. When executing this scaling rule, Auto Scaling adds only one instance to the group to prevent TotalCapacity \(the current number of instances in the group\) from exceeding MaxSize \(the maximum number of instances allowed in the group\).
-   Example 2: A scaling group has a MinSize of 2, a TotalCapacity of 3, and a scaling rule of removing five ECS instances. When executing this scaling rule, Auto Scaling removes only one instance from the group to prevent TotalCapacity \(the current number of instances in the group\) from becoming smaller than MinSize \(the minimum number of instances allowed in the group\).

You can create scaling rules based on input parameters.

-   When AdjustmentType is set to TotalCapacity, the number of ECS instances currently in the scaling group is adjusted to the specified value. The value of AdjustmentValue must be greater than or equal to 0.
-   When AdjustmentType is set to QuantityChangeInCapacity or PercentChangeInCapacity, a positive value of AdjustmentValue indicates ECS instances to be added, and a negative value of AdjustmentValue indicates ECS instances to be removed.
-   When AdjustmentType is set to PercentChangeInCapacity, Auto Scaling rounds the number of ECS instances to be scaled to a nearest integer based on the formula: Number of ECS instances to be scaled = \(Current number of instances Ã— Value of AdjustmentValue/100\).
-   When the cooldown time is specified in a scaling rule, the specified time is applied to the scaling group after this rule is executed. If the cooldown time is not specified, the default cooldown time is applied to the scaling group.
-   A scaling group can have a maximum of 50 scaling rules.
-   The following operations use the unique identifier of a scaling rule \(ScalingRuleAri\) returned by CreateScalingRule:
    -   ExecuteScalingRule: You can call this operation to manually execute a specified scaling rule by setting ScalingRuleAri to the identifier.
    -   CreateScheduledTask: You can call this operation to create a periodically executed task for a specified scaling rule by setting ScheduledAction to the identifier.

The system adds ECS instances in the warm-up state to a scaling group, but does not report monitoring data to CloudMonitor during the warm-up period.

-   IntranetRx: the average intranet inbound traffic
-   IntranetTx: the average intranet outbound traffic

 |
|StepAdjustment.N.ScalingAdjustment|Integer|No|1|The specified number of instances to be scaled in step adjustment N.
