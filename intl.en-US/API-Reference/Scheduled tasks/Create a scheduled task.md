# Create a scheduled task {#concept_25957_zh .concept}

This operation creates a scheduled task according to input parameters.

## Description {#section_qck_hgl_sfb .section}

-   You can create up to 20 scheduled tasks.
-   When the trigger of a scheduled task fails because a scaling activity in a scaling group is in progress or the scaling group is disabled, the scheduled task is automatically retried within the `LaunchExpirationTime`; otherwise, the scheduled trigger task is abandoned.
-   If multiple tasks are scheduled at similar times to execute the rule of the same group, the earliest task triggers the scaling activity first, and other tasks make attempts to execute the rule within their `LaunchExpirationTime` because a scaling group executes only one scaling activity at a time. If another scheduled task is still making triggering attempts within its `LaunchExpirationTime` after the scaling activity is finished, the scaling rule is executed and the corresponding scaling activity is triggered.
