# ExecuteScalingRule {#concept_25953_zh .concept}

Executes a specified scaling rule.

## Description {#section_e5k_vzk_sfb .section}

-   The interface can be called only when the scaling group is active.
-   The interface can be called only when no scaling activity in the scaling group is in progress.
-   When no scaling activity in the scaling group is in progress, the interface can be directly executed without cooldown.
-   Successfully calling this interface only means that the Auto Scaling service has accepted the call request, and the scaling activity can be executed, but does not necessarily mean that the scaling activity can be successfully executed. You can use the returned ScalingActivityId to check the status of the scaling activity.
-   When the total capacity of to-be-attached ECS instances specified by this scaling rule plus the instances in the current scaling group is greater than MaxSize, the rule Total Capacity = MaxSize is applied.
-   When the total capacity of instances in the current scaling group minus the number of ECS instances to be reduced according to the scaling rule is smaller than MinSize, the rule Total Capacity = MinSize is applied.
-   You can only perform auto scaling for at most 1,000 ECS instances of all scaling groups in all regions. \( The number only includes the number of ECS instances automatically created, but does not include the number of manually attached ECS instances.\)
