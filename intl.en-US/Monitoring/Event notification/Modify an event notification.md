1.  Log on to the [Auto Scaling console](https://essnew.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Scaling Groups**.

3.  In the top navigation bar, select a region.

4.  Find the scaling group and use one of the following methods to open the details page of the scaling group:

    -   Click the ID of the scaling group in the **Scaling Group Name/ID** column.
    -   Click **Details** in the **Actions** column.
5.  In the upper part of the page, click the **Event Notifications** tab.

6.  Find the event notification and click **Edit** in the **Actions** column.

7.  Configure the event notification types.
