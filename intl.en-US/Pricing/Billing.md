however, all ECS instances that Auto Scaling automatically creates, or manually adds, to a scaling group will be charged according to their instance types. For pricing information of ECS instances, see [pricing overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pricing overview.md#). The No fees for stopped instances feature only applies to VPC-connected Pay-As-You-Go instances.
