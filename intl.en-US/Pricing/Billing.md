# Billing {#concept_nw2_h3m_qfb .concept}

This topic introduces the billing information of Auto Scaling.

Auto Scaling is a free service, however, all ECS instances that Auto Scaling automatically creates, or manually adds, to a scaling group will be charged according to their instance types. For pricing information of ECS instances, see [pricing overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pricing overview.md#). The No fees for stopped instances feature only applies to VPC-connected Pay-As-You-Go instances. For more information, see [No fees for stopped VPC instances](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/No fees for stopped VPC instances.md#).

**Note:** You can only select [Pay-As-You-Go](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go.md#) or [Preemptible Instance](../../../../reseller.en-US/Instances/Instance purchasing options/Preemptible instances/Preemptible instances.md#) when creating a scaling configuration.
