# Change the status of a scaling group {#task188 .task}

This topic describes how to change the status of a scaling group.

After you [create a scaling group](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Use custom scaling configurations to create scaling groups.md#), you can disable scaling groups that are no longer in use, and re-enable them as needed.

1.  Log on to the [Auto Scaling console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ess). 
2.   On the Scaling Groups page, click More in the **Actions** column corresponding to the scaling group to be disabled. Choose **Disable** from the shortcut menu. In the **Actions** column corresponding to the scaling group to be enabled, click More. Choose **Enable** from the shortcut menu. 
3.  Check whether the status in the **Status** column corresponding to the scaling group has been changed accordingly.
