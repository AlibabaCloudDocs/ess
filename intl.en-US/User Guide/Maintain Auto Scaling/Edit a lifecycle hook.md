# Edit a lifecycle hook {#task254 .task}

This topic describes how to edit a lifecycle hook.

After you [create a lifecycle hook](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Realize Auto Scaling/Create a lifecycle hook.md#), when the lifecycle hook no longer meets your requirements, you do not need to delete it and create a new one. You can change the properties of the lifecycle hook to meet your requirements.

1.  Log on to the [Auto Scaling console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ess). 
2.  On the Scale Groups page, click **Manage** in the **Actions** column for the target scaling group. 
3.  On the Lifecycle Hooks page, click **Edit** in the **Actions** column for the target lifecycle hook. 
4.  In the Modify Lifecycle Hook dialog box, change the properties of the lifecycle hook, and then click **Edit Lifecycle Hook**.
