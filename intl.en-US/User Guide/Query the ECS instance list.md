# Query the ECS instance list {#concept_hzd_5d2_sfb .concept}

This article describes how to query the ECS instance list.

ECS instances not in the **Running**\(`Running`\) status are regarded as unhealthy. Auto Scaling automatically removes unhealthy ECS instances from the scaling groups. Automatically created ECS instances are created by the Auto Scaling service based on scaling configuration and rules. Manually added ECS instances are manually added to a scaling group, not created by the Auto Scaling service.
