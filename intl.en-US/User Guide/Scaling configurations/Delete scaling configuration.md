# Delete scaling configuration {#task_ihs_s14_qfb .task}

You can delete scaling configuration.

Before you delete a scale configuration, make sure the following conditions are met, otherwise, the deletion fails:

-   The scaling configuration to be deleted is in the **Inactive** status.
-   If any ECS instances still used for a scaling group and are created according to the scaling configuration, the scaling configuration cannot be deleted.

1.  Log on to the [Auto Scaling](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ess) console, and click **Manage** in the **Actions** column. 
2.  Go to the Scaling Configuration page, and click **Delete** in the **Actions** column after the specified scaling configuration. 

    You can also check the box at the left of the scale configuration, and then click **Delete** to delete multiple scaling configurations.

3.  In the Delete Scaling Configuration dialog box, click **OK**.
