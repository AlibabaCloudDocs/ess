# Modify scaling configurations {#task384 .task}

When business requirements change, you can improve efficiency by modifying the required options of the current scaling configuration rather than creating a new scaling configuration.

For more information about configuration items, see [Create an instance by using the wizard](../../../../../reseller.en-US/Instances/Create an instance/Create an instance by using the wizard.md#).

1.  Log on to the [Auto Scaling Console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ess). 
2.  On the Scaling Groups page, click **Manage** in the **Actions** column. 
3.  In the left-side navigation pane, select Instance Configuration Source. 
4.  On the Scaling Configurations tab, click **Modify** in the **Actions** column. 
5.  On the Basic Configurations page, modify the required options, then click **Next: System Configurations**. 
6.  On the System Configurations page, modify the required options, then click **Next: Preview**. 
7.  On the Preview \(Required\) page, click **Modify**. 

    **Note:** After you modify a scaling configuration, ECS instances that are created based on the scaling configuration still work as expected.
