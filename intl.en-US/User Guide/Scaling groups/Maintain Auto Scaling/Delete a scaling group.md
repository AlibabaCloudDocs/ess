# Delete a scaling group {#task_z52_klx_rfb .task}

This article describes the steps to delete a scaling group.

You can delete a scaling group if you no longer need it.

**Note:** Deleting a scaling group also deletes its scaling configurations and scaling rules. If the scaling group includes ECS instance in the Running status, Auto Scaling stops the ECS instance first, removes all manually added instances, and releases all automatically created instances.

1.  On the Scaling Groups page, click **Delete** in the **Actions** column next to the scaling group to be deleted. 
2.  In the Delete Scaling Group dialog box, click **Confirm**. 
3.  On the Scaling Groups page, click **Refresh** to confirm that the deletion has completed.
