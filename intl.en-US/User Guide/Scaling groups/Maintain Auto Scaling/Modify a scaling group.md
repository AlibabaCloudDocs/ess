# Modify a scaling group {#concept_qkz_nkx_rfb .concept}

This article introduces the steps to modify a scaling group.

After [creating a scaling group](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Scaling groups/Realize Auto Scaling/Create a scaling group.md#), you can modify the attributes of a scaling group after it is created.

**Note:** If the number of ECS instances \(Total Capacity\) in the scaling group does not meet the new **MaxSize** or **MinSize** settings, Auto Scaling adds or removes ECS instances to or from the group until the MaxSize or MinSize value is reached.

## Procedure {#section_psv_wkx_rfb .section}

Following these steps to modify the attributes of a scale group:

1.  On the Scaling Groups page, click **Modify** in the **Actions** column next to the scaling group to be modified.
