# Manage scheduled tasks {#concept_bqv_zzc_sfb .concept}

After you create a scheduled task, you can enable, disable, modify, and delete a scheduled task at any time based on business changes.

## Enable or disable a scheduled task {#section_ucm_1nn_jgb .section}

After you create a scheduled task, the task is automatically enabled. You can manually disable tasks that are currently not required.

1.  Log on to the [Auto Scaling Console](https://essnew.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  Choose **Scaling Tasks** \> **Scheduled Tasks**.
3.  On the Scheduled Tasks page, click **Disable** in the **Actions** column.
4.  In the Disable Scheduled Task dialog box, click **Confirm**.

    **Note:** After you disable a scheduled task, in the **Actions** column, the button changes from **Disable** to **Enable**. You can re-enable a disabled scheduled task in the same way you disable the scheduled task.


## Modify a scheduled task {#section_hbn_wmn_jgb .section}

When the requirement of a scheduled task changes, such as execution time, scaling rule, or reference period, you can modify the task rather than creating a new one.

**Note:** This step only describes where to modify a scheduled task. For more information about configuration items, see [Create a scheduled task](intl.en-US/User Guide/Scheduled tasks/Create a scheduled task.md#).

1.  Log on to the [Auto Scaling Console](https://essnew.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  Choose **Scaling Tasks** \> **Scheduled Tasks**.
3.  On the Scheduled Tasks page, click **Edit** in the **Actions** column.
4.  In the Edit Scheduled Task dialog box, modify the required options, then click **OK**.

## Delete a scheduled task {#section_izr_bnn_jgb .section}

You can delete scheduled tasks that are no longer required to release more scheduled task quotas.

1.  Log on to the [Auto Scaling Console](https://essnew.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  Choose **Scaling Tasks** \> **Scheduled Tasks**.
3.  On the Scheduled Tasks page, click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.
4.  In the Delete Scheduled Task dialog box, click **Confirm**.
